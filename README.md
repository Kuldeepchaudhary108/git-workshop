Learnings in Git- workshop
What I Learned
During the Git workshop, I learned about the basic Git commands. Some of the key commands I practiced include:
git init – To initialize a new Git repository.
git add – To stage changes before committing.
git commit – To save changes with a descriptive message.
git status – To check the current state of the repository.
git log – To view the commit history.
git branch – To create and manage branches.
git checkout – To switch between branches.
git push and git pull – To upload and download changes to and from a remote repository.
git clone – To copy a remote repository to the local system.

At the end of the workshop, I was given a mini assignment to implement what I learned and create a README file
